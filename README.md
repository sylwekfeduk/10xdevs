## Overview

HealthyMeal is an MVP application designed to solve the challenge of adapting existing recipes to individual dietary needs. Users can manually input recipes and use AI to automatically modify them based on their specified preferences such as:

- 🥜 **Allergens** - Avoid specific ingredients that cause allergic reactions
- 🥗 **Dietary Preferences** - Follow specific diets (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
- 🚫 **Disliked Ingredients** - Exclude ingredients you simply don't like

The AI modification feature generates a new version of the recipe while preserving the original, giving users full control over their recipe collection.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **User Authentication**
  - Email/password registration and login
  - Social login (Google OAuth)
  - Guided onboarding process

- **User Profile & Preferences**
  - Allergen selection (dropdown)
  - Diet type selection (dropdown)
  - Disliked ingredients (free text input)

- **Recipe Management (CRUD)**
  - Add recipes manually (title, ingredients, instructions)
  - View saved recipes
  - Delete recipes (both original and AI-modified versions)
  - Save multiple versions of the same recipe

- **AI-Powered Recipe Modification**
  - "Customize to my preferences" button on each recipe
  - AI analyzes recipe against user preferences
  - Generates new recipe version with appropriate substitutions
  - Clear disclaimer for AI-generated content (especially for allergies)
  - Option to save modified recipe

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/10xdevs.git
   cd 10xdevs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env .env
   ```

   Then edit `.env` with your credentials (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section).

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
```

**Where to get these:**
- **Supabase credentials**: Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and find your URL and anon key in Project Settings > API
- **OpenRouter API key**: Sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) and generate an API key in your account settings

## Project Scope (MVP)

### In Scope ✅

1. **Authentication System**
   - Email/password login
   - At least one social provider (Google)
   - Onboarding flow with mandatory preference setup

2. **User Preferences**
   - Allergen management (selection list)
   - Diet type selection (selection list)
   - Disliked ingredients (free text)

3. **Recipe Management**
   - Manual recipe input via form (title, ingredients, instructions)
   - View saved recipes
   - Delete recipes (original and AI versions independently)

4. **AI Recipe Modification**
   - Modify existing recipes only (no generation from scratch)
   - Create new copy instead of overwriting original
   - Display clear disclaimer on AI-generated content
   - Save modified versions to user library

### Out of Scope (MVP) ❌

- Recipe import from URLs
- AI recipe generation from scratch
- Recipe sharing between users
- Meal planning features
- Shopping list generation
- Nutritional information calculation

## Success Metrics

The MVP focuses on measuring two key metrics:

1. **User Activation**: **90%** of newly registered users define at least one preference (allergy, diet, or disliked ingredient) during onboarding

2. **Core Value Engagement**: **75%** of Weekly Active Users (WAU) use the AI modification feature at least once per week

3. **Retention** (Indirect): Monitor WAU/MAU ratio as a general product stickiness indicator

4. **Business/Risk Indicator**: Track average AI API cost per active user per week
