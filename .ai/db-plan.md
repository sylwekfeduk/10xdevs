# HealthyMeal Database Schema

## Overview
This document describes the PostgreSQL database schema for the HealthyMeal MVP application. The schema is designed to support user authentication (via Supabase), recipe management, AI-powered recipe modifications, and comprehensive tracking for key product metrics.

## Key Design Principles
- **Security First**: Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables containing user data
- **Data Integrity**: UUID primary keys, foreign key constraints, and NOT NULL constraints where appropriate
- **Metric Tracking**: Dedicated logging for measuring 90% activation and 75% WAU AI engagement
- **Scalability**: Prepared for future growth with indexed foreign keys and JSONB for flexible data
- **Clean Deletion**: CASCADE rules ensure complete data cleanup on account deletion

## 1. Tables

### 1.1 `profiles`
Stores application-specific user data with a one-to-one relationship to Supabase's `auth.users` table.

**Columns:**

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | `UUID` | `PRIMARY KEY` | Primary key, matches `auth.users.id` |
| `user_id` | `UUID` | `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` | Foreign key to auth.users (one-to-one) |
| `full_name` | `TEXT` | `NULL` | User's full name (optional) |
| `avatar_url` | `TEXT` | `NULL` | URL to user's avatar image (optional) |
| `allergies` | `TEXT[]` | `NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'` | Array of allergen strings (e.g., 'peanuts', 'gluten') |
| `diets` | `TEXT[]` | `NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'` | Array of diet strings (e.g., 'vegetarian', 'vegan') |
| `disliked_ingredients` | `TEXT[]` | `NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'` | Array of disliked ingredient strings |
| `has_completed_onboarding` | `BOOLEAN` | `NOT NULL DEFAULT false` | Tracks if user has completed onboarding (for 90% activation metric) |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | `NOT NULL DEFAULT now()` | Timestamp of profile creation |
| `updated_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | `NOT NULL DEFAULT now()` | Timestamp of last update (auto-managed by trigger) |

**Notes:**
- The `user_id` field is separate from `id` to maintain flexibility in case the relationship needs to change
- For MVP, preferences are stored as `TEXT[]` arrays for simplicity
- Post-MVP consideration: Normalize preferences into separate tables (`allergens`, `diets`, etc.) with junction tables

### 1.2 `recipes`
Stores all recipe data, including both user-created originals and AI-modified copies.

**Columns:**

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | `UUID` | `PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()` | Primary key |
| `user_id` | `UUID` | `NOT NULL`, `REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` | Owner of the recipe |
| `title` | `TEXT` | `NOT NULL`, `CHECK (length(title) > 0)` | Recipe title (cannot be empty) |
| `ingredients` | `TEXT` | `NOT NULL` | Recipe ingredients as text |
| `instructions` | `TEXT` | `NOT NULL` | Recipe instructions as text |
| `original_recipe_id` | `UUID` | `NULL`, `REFERENCES recipes(id) ON DELETE SET NULL` | Self-referencing FK to link AI-modified copies to original |
| `changes_summary` | `JSONB` | `NULL` | List of AI modifications in JSON format (e.g., `[{"type": "substitution", "from": "beef", "to": "tofu"}]`) |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | `NOT NULL DEFAULT now()` | Timestamp of recipe creation |
| `updated_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | `NOT NULL DEFAULT now()` | Timestamp of last update (auto-managed by trigger) |

**Notes:**
- `original_recipe_id` is `NULL` for user-created originals and contains a UUID for AI-modified copies
- `changes_summary` uses `JSONB` for flexibility in storing structured AI modification data
- `ON DELETE SET NULL` for `original_recipe_id` preserves AI-modified copies if original is deleted
- `CHECK` constraint ensures title is not an empty string

### 1.3 `ai_modifications_log`
Tracks every AI modification request for metric analysis and debugging.

**Columns:**

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | `UUID` | `PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()` | Primary key |
| `user_id` | `UUID` | `NOT NULL`, `REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` | User who requested the modification |
| `original_recipe_id` | `UUID` | `NOT NULL`, `REFERENCES recipes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` | The recipe that was modified |
| `modified_recipe_id` | `UUID` | `NULL`, `REFERENCES recipes(id) ON DELETE SET NULL` | The resulting AI-modified recipe (NULL if not saved) |
| `user_preferences_snapshot` | `JSONB` | `NOT NULL` | Snapshot of user preferences at time of modification (for analysis) |
| `ai_model_used` | `TEXT` | `NULL` | Name/version of AI model used (e.g., 'gpt-4-turbo') |
| `ai_cost_estimate` | `DECIMAL(10, 6)` | `NULL` | Estimated API cost for this modification |
| `processing_time_ms` | `INTEGER` | `NULL` | Time taken to process the modification in milliseconds |
| `was_successful` | `BOOLEAN` | `NOT NULL DEFAULT true` | Whether the AI modification completed successfully |
| `error_message` | `TEXT` | `NULL` | Error message if modification failed |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | `NOT NULL DEFAULT now()` | Timestamp of modification request |

**Notes:**
- Critical for measuring the 75% WAU AI engagement metric
- `user_preferences_snapshot` stores preferences at time of modification for later analysis
- Cost and performance tracking fields support business analytics
- `ON DELETE SET NULL` for `modified_recipe_id` preserves logs even if result is deleted

## 2. Relationships

### 2.1 One-to-One Relationships
- **`auth.users` → `profiles`**: Each authenticated user has exactly one profile
  - Implemented via `profiles.user_id` UNIQUE constraint

### 2.2 One-to-Many Relationships
- **`auth.users` → `recipes`**: A user can have many recipes
  - Foreign key: `recipes.user_id` → `auth.users.id`

- **`auth.users` → `ai_modifications_log`**: A user can have many AI modification events
  - Foreign key: `ai_modifications_log.user_id` → `auth.users.id`

- **`recipes` → `ai_modifications_log`**: A recipe can be modified multiple times
  - Foreign key: `ai_modifications_log.original_recipe_id` → `recipes.id`

### 2.3 Self-Referencing Relationships
- **`recipes` → `recipes`**: An AI-modified recipe references its original
  - Foreign key: `recipes.original_recipe_id` → `recipes.id`
  - This allows querying all AI variations of a given recipe

## 3. Indexes

Indexes improve query performance for frequently accessed data and foreign key lookups.
